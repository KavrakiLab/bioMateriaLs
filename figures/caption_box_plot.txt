Figure2. Material accuracy is plotted for the whole dataset. Datapoints that share the same PPF composition, printing speed, printing pressure and programed spacing are combined in a box plot. Material accuracy values are shown on the y-axis. Printing configuration of datapoints is shown on the x-axis (PPF-composition (wt%);printing pressure (bar);printing speed (mm/s); programmed spacing (mm) respectively).
