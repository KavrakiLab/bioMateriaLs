FigureX. Figure contains the 3D visualization of material accuracy-speed-pressure relationship for the part of the dataset with PPF composition 85. The data is shown in green. Each pillar contains configurations with the same speed-pressure value and different values of layer and spacing. The yellow plane represents the threshold of 50% material accuracy. The purple plane shows the function learned by the linear regression model. Red line represents the intersection between these two planes.
